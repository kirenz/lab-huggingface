## Getting Started with Transformers

Learn how to use transformers in Hugging Face: 

- Transformer neural networks can be used to tackle a wide range of tasks in natural language processing and beyond.
- Transfer learning allows one to adapt Transformers to specific tasks.
- The `pipeline()` function from the transformers library can be used to run inference with models from the Hugging Face Hub.
