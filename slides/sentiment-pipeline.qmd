# Python setup

- You need Anaconda or Miniconda

- Install this virtual environment [env-transformers.yml](https://github.com/kirenz/environments) 


```{python}
from transformers import pipeline
```


# Intuition

![](images/text-classification.png)

- Text classification: assigning a label or class to a given text

- Sentiment analysis is the automated process of tagging data according to their sentiment:
  - Positive, negative and neutral


## Use Cases

- Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

- You can track the sentiments of your customers from the product reviews using sentiment analysis models. 

- This can help understand churn and retention by grouping reviews by sentiment, to later analyze the text and make strategic decisions based on this knowledge.


# Pipeline

## Pipeline example with default model


```{python}
# | code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4|6"

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

data = ["I love you",
        "I hate you"]

sentiment_pipeline(data)

```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998656511306763},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991129040718079}]
```


## Pipeline example with specific model

```{python}

specific_model = pipeline(
    model="finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis")
```

. . .

```{python}
specific_model(data)
```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.9916695356369019},
 {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9806600213050842}]
```
