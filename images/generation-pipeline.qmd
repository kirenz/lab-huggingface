. . .

```{python}

## Use Cases

- Stories Generation

- Code Generation: can help programmers in their repetitive coding tasks.

## Task Variants

- Completion Generation Models
  - Given an incomplete sentence, complete it.
  - Continue a story given the first sentences.
  - Provided a code description, generate the code.

- Text-to-Text Generation Models
  - Translation
  - Summarization
  - Text classification

- Inference
  -  takes an incomplete text and returns multiple outputs with which the text can be completed.

# Pipeline example 

## Create pipeline with GPT-2

```{python}

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

```

## Provide text

```{python}

my_text = "Hello, I study online media management"

```

## Make inference

```{python}

generator(my_text, max_length=30, num_return_sequences=3)

```

## Output


```{python}
[{'generated_text': 'Hello, I study online media management, and while most of my courses focus on the business, I specialize in online development.\n\nIf you know'},
 {'generated_text': 'Hello, I study online media management at a computer-focused high school. One of my favorite exercises is watching and reading my students write things.\n'},
 {'generated_text': 'Hello, I study online media management, so I know that it\'s not the best idea to be a part of the digital environment yourself."\n\n'}]

```
