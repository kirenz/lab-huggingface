For instance, we may suspect drinking a high-calorie energy drink will improve performance in a race. To check if there really is a causal relationship between the explanatory variable (whether the runner drank an energy drink or not) and the response variable (the race time), researchers identify a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized experiment. Random assignment organizes the participants in a study into groups that are roughly equal on all aspects, thus allowing us to control for any confounding variables that might affect the outcome (e.g., fitness level, racing experience, etc.). For example, each runner in the experiment could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a placebo (fake treatment, in this case a no-calorie drink) and the second group receives the high-calorie energy drink. See the case study in Section 1.1 for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo. Researchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a cohort of many similar individuals to form hypotheses about why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection as they do not offer a mechanism for controlling for confounding variables.\""

First, create a Hugging Face account if you do not already have one, by visiting https://huggingface.co/ and clicking “Sign Up”\nB. Once you are logged in, click on your profile picture and then click on “New Space” underneath it to get to this page: https://huggingface.co/new-space\nC. Give your Space a name and a license. Select “Gradio” as the Space SDK, and then choose “Public” if you are fine with everyone accessing your Space and the underlying code\nD. Then you will find a page that provides you instructions on how to upload your files into the Git repository for that Space. You may also need to add a requirements.txt file to specify any Python package dependencies.\nE. Once you have pushed your files, that’s it! Spaces will automatically build your Gradio demo allowing you to share it with anyone, anywhere!"
