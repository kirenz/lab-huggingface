Leider, als ich das Paket öffnete, entdeckte ich zu meinem Entsetzen, dass ich stattdessen eine Action Figur von Megatron geschickt worden war! Als lebenslanger Feind der Decepticons, Ich hoffe, Sie können mein Dilemma verstehen. Um das Problem zu lösen, Ich fordere einen Austausch von Megatron für die Optimus Prime Figur habe ich bestellt. Eingeschlossen sind Kopien meiner Aufzeichnungen über diesen Kauf. Ich erwarte, von Ihnen bald zu hören. Aufrichtig, Bumblebee."
